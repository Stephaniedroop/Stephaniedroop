Hi, I’m Steph. 

I'm a PhD student at University of Edinburgh in computational cognitive modelling (aka 'doing psychology with the tools of computer science'). My research is on how we decide something is a cause of something else. I use the methodology of causal structural models and Bayesian inference, and work from simpler to richer scenarios, ending on modelling people's free text explanations for a variety of outcomes.

The main repos on here to see my work are from my PhD:

1. Collider (either '_cogsci25' or '_cognition'). Chapter 1 of my thesis: where I model how people combine causal inference and causal selection in a simple determinative structure where two possible causes A and B can cause effect E, and each has an accompanying unobserved counterpart.
2. Gridworld ('gw'). Chapter 2 of my thesis: where I model different agents' choice of food and path. The agents have differnet biographical details which make their behaviour more or less congruous.
3. Continuation of gridworld, not written yet.

Other good repos are `TuringToM` which was as standalone project on a Turing test for large language models. The data got largely superseded when the field moved very fast, but there are some good visualisations in ggplot. 


You can read more details on the README for each project.

Some repos are old, sells or just for practice. Avoid any that have not been updated since 2022!
