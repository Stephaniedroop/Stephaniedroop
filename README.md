Hi, I’m @Stephaniedroop (Steph)

I'm a PhD student at University of Edinburgh in computational cognitive modelling. This is 'doing psychology with the tools of computer science' and my main project is about how people suggest new explanations to explain the surprising behaviour of others.

What I mean by that is: say you see your mate Pete running across campus to the pizza van. Why? That's easy to explain if you know Pete likes pizza, and it's lunch time. Easy! But what if you know Pete's on a diet, doesn't like pizza, and it isn't even lunchtime? It seems toally normal that we humans would start to hypothesise and brainstorm: maybe he knows the person who works there and he's dropping off his keys, maybe he saw his kid run into the road behind the van... any number of reasons. 

Current systems can't do this, so it seems a good place to start to formalise what it is about human minds is special, and how we might make systems later that can do it.

I made a start on this with a project called `gw`, which stands for `gridworld` (little square depictions of worlds that characters can move about in, like a cartoon urban environment).

My main programming language is R. 

I use that for data analysis and visualisation, (see TuringToM project, more details below), and for programming models using probability distributions, simulation and logic (`gw`). 

You can read more details on the README for each project.
